## gen-passwd

Simple password generator to follow the wisdom of [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/936/)

There are probably other (better) tools out there that provide this functionality
but I hacked this together for fun

#### sample invocation
```
$ gen-passwd
womankind hereditarianism internationally
```
and if you're not happy with the result, just run the script again...
```
$ gen-passwd
azocyclic Buddha ghostship
```
